## MY IDEAS FOR THE SPACEESHIP PROJECT



* ###### Make the game a game where they are two players trying to shoot at each other
* ###### Make p1 and p2
* ###### Allow both players spaceships to be able to move in any direction	
* ###### Make p1 and p2 be able to choose what colour of spaceship they want from a limited amount
* ###### Allow both players spaceship to be able fire bullets/mini-lasers at the opponent
* ###### Make both players have at least 10 lives and they are shot by the opponent they lose one of their lives
* ###### Make the game a no border game where you can move anywhere
* ###### When you go across a sides you will come out of the other border
* ###### They will be boosters like: +1 live, Shrinking, Force field etc 
* ###### Every 2mins of a single round a random booster will drop
* ###### When a player wins display on the screen that p1/p2 won
* ###### When p1/p2 wins restart the game
* ###### Keep a tally for how many times p1/p2 wins until program is closed
